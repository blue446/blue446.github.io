HTML based GUI for xBuilder application.


Just a quick little website for the xBuilder GUI. My HTML and CSS experience is limited, so it may be fairly messy. This is meant solely for myself and my application. Issue requests are allowed for those who find a problem that I need to address. Two similar popup html files that could have been condensed into 1 was intentional. I was experiencing bugs in pywebview and was too lazy to debug as this is just a quick website.
